Apple Calendar to .csv <br>
(with Automator (macOS only))
___
### Overview
__IMPORTANT__: Create an Automator-Calendar event (repeated monthly) to automatically run to [workflow](automator/workcal.workflow)

### Overview
+ Automator does Event Summary of a Single Calendar (Choose Calendar)
+ python is run via apple-script (Update path)
+ Saves csv to Desktop

Some other actions are for my own comfort (puts some alias to Desktop).
